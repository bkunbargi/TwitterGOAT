Trump turning over President Obama‚Äôs ambassador to the Russians, for interrogation, when he‚Äôs done nothing wrong but criticize Putin, is un-American, says @will_c_fischer.  If you‚Äôre a veteran who agrees, be heard by commenting below! #ProtectMcFaul https://t.co/cGtw8voeu6
Former Russian Diplomat Mike McFaul stood up for the U.S. when he was our Ambassador to Russia and now Trump is trying to hand him over to Putin. We are not a country that feeds our political opponents to foreign governments lineskiphttps://t.co/fUlIC7NDGJ #ProtectMcFaul
Watch as Former President Obama completely destroys Donald Trump without a single mention of his name.lineskiplineskipThis is what true leadership looks like! #MandelaLecture lineskip https://t.co/ET6XvufUMB
Obama was roasted by the right for apologizing for some of the past action of the US. Trump blames the US and Trump is revered.

The 3 Amigos (Clapper/Comey/Brennan) pictured at top of NYT piece that tries to resuscitate credibility of Obama intel assessment that they crafted. All 3 engaged in espionage campaign against Trump. Not trustworthy. "Scoop" comes from compromised sources.lineskiphttps://t.co/gQ9Vr4sUXb https://t.co/RfhwwiJ5DX
Opinion: Trump‚Äôs Helsinki outing was tone-deaf but his policy is cribbed from Bush and Obama, writes @HolmanJenkins https://t.co/DlJq0WO27r
John Brennan spread the Steele dossier around the Intel community intending for it to be leaked to the media. It was AND he showed it to Obama and said he believed Russians were trying to help @realDonaldTrump win the  election. No one else in the intel community shared his view
That would also mean Obama had the same info, and actually MORE info than President Elect Trump.  What was he doing?  Was he asleep at the wheel or what? https://t.co/pfUl9UnJvn

The son of a b*tch Obama is yapping about Trump's meeting with Putin while he's in South Africa meeting with Cyril Ramaphosa, South Africa's president whose government is confiscating white farms and murdering those whites who resist. I guess his silence means that he approves?

@FloridaVoterNPA @realDonaldTrump Obama met with Putin 3 times plus numerous phone calls, got the transcripts ???
"There‚Äôs been no president ever as tough as I have been on Russia.‚Äù - Donald Trump today. (Except at least EVERY president since the beginning of the Cold War... Truman, Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon, Ford, Carter, Reagan, George HW Bush, Clinton, George W Bush, and Obama)
@realDonaldTrump @RandPaul If they would do a true investigation on Obamas administration!!!!!!  You can use your index finger on a dusty desk!!!  and see the corruption !  Treason,  Working with the Russians. America wants Justice ! Mr.Trump use your power and bring charges against Obama !
BREAKING: White House @PressSec says Trump will be meeting with his team to consider Putin's request to see President Obama's Ambassador to Russia @McFaul interrogated for the Russians.lineskiplineskipThat this Putin request has not been forcefully rejected is a travesty.
